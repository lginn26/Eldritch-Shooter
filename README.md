## Backstory
The galaxy was once a peaceful place. Until one day, a portal opened up 
and from it poured eldritch horrors beyond one's comprehension. The galactic 
governments responded by sending pilots to close the portal and rid the 
galaxy of this threat. However, all the men who have been sent have 
never returned. Will you end up the same way?
